## Description

For this project I created a simple and easy to use weather tracking website that takes inputs of the cities names and pulls up a five day forcast of the city that was searched.

## Usage

To use the website click the link in assets.
Once the user is on the page they can then use the search bar to search for the weather for any city.
After the user hits the search button it will dynamically populate on the screen with the five day forecast.
After a search is made it will be saved in local storage and be displayed under the search bar to be used again for a quicker search.
